A veces otros describen lo que me pasa, mejor de lo que podría ser capaz. En este caso es Austin Kleon, explicando por que el computador no sirve para generar ideas. 

>The computer is really good for editing your ideas, and it’s really good for
getting your ideas ready for publishing out into the world, but it’s not really
good for generating ideas. There are too many opportunities to hit the delete key.
The computer brings out the uptight perfectionist in us—we start editing ideas
before we have them. The cartoonist Tom Gauld says he stays away from the
computer until he’s done most of the thinking for his strips, because once the
computer is involved, “things are on an inevitable path to being finished.
Whereas in my sketchbook the possibilities are endless.”
